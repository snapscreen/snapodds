Unless otherwise agreed to, all\n            arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration\n            Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries,\n            affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors,\n            and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or\n            beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>\n              (b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.\n            </strong>{\" \"}\n            Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send\n            to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing\n            the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested\n            relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 9 E. LOOCKERMAN\n            STREET SUITE 311, DOVER, Delaware 19901. After the Notice is\n            received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or\n            dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim\n            or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received,\n            either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any\n            settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the\n            arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of\n            the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>(c) Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be\n            initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an\n            established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”)\n            that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not\n            available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an\n            alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern\n            all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the\n            method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the\n            extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer\n            Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration\n            are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at\n            1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single,\n            neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of\n            the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US\n            $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based\n            arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims\n            or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten\n            Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a\n            hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing\n            will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence,\n            unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the\n            parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the\n            arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date,\n            time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award\n            rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent\n            jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater\n            than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to\n            the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater\n            of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs\n            (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the\n            arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of\n            the ADR Provider.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>\n              (d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.\n            </strong>{\" \"}\n            If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration\n            shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on\n            written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the\n            party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve\n            any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise\n            agreed by the parties.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>(e) Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursue\n            arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or\n            demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline\n            for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA\n            Rules for the pertinent claim.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>(f) Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is\n            initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if\n            any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be\n            consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases\n            or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions\n            dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have\n            the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any\n            non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under\n            applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall\n            issue a written award and statement of decision describing the\n            essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,\n            including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has\n            the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a\n            judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is\n            final and binding upon you and the Company.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>(g) Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE\n            THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A\n            TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all\n            claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this\n            Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more\n            limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a\n            court and are subject to very limited review by a court.

These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may\n            not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred\n            by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted\n            assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the\n            foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these\n            Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be\n            binding upon assignees.\n          </p>\n          <h3>10.7 Copyright/Trademark Information</h3>\n          <p>\n            Copyright © 2020 Snapscreen Inc.
